# 📺 TVx — the warmth of modern nostalgia

This is the way - television you remember feeling: present, unhurried, *analog*.

- TVx brings back the ritual of watching—not scrolling, not seeking, just *being* with what's on.

- Like the grain of 35mm film 🎞️ or the crackle before a record drops 💿, it trades sterile perfection for something alive.

- Curved glass 📟. Gentle flicker ✨. Scanlines that breathe.

- The soft bokeh of vintage anamorphic lenses 🎥—edges that blur like looking through aged glass, chromatic fringing that feels organic, not digital.

- The glow of a neon clock 🕰️ counting Saturday mornings long past

## What it does

An IPTV + EPG viewer for **Tunarr** (Plex/Jellyfin) playlists and XMLTV guides. Built for channel surfing, not catalog anxiety. Anti‑algorithm. Pro‑moment. Vibing.

**Architecture**: TVx is a client-side web frontend that interfaces with your **Tunarr backend** alongside your **Plex library**. It consumes M3U playlists and XMLTV EPG data generated by Tunarr, while displaying rich metadata and artwork from your Plex media server.

## Why it feels different

- ⚡ **Instant channel surfing** — hold ↑/↓ to skim; land when something catches your eye
- 📟 **CRT warmth** — curvature, chromatic aberration, scanlines, vignette
- 📅 **Full TV guide** — press G for a 12‑hour timeline across all channels with poster artwork
- 🎬 **Theater modes** — click the player to cycle views (guide → normal → immersive)
- 🏷️ **Smart channel names** — strips filler words, adds icons
