- Complete code explanations (logging endpoint, range requests, MIME types)
- Environment configuration with `envsubst`
- Logging system architecture (browser → server → Docker logs)
- Testing commands and troubleshooting
- Performance considerations and future improvements

**Purpose:** Explain the server.js architecture, HTTP Range Request support, and logging implementation.

### 3. Troubleshooting Guide

**Location:** `docs/troubleshooting.md`

Complete troubleshooting guide covering:

- Channels not loading (environment variables, CORS, network)
- Video not playing (HLS streams, browser compatibility)
- Loading VHS video issues (with reference to bug fix)
- EPG not showing (XMLTV parsing)
- Docker issues (ports, rebuilds, logs)
- Performance problems
- Browser console errors with explanations
- Quick diagnostic checklist

**Purpose:** Help users quickly resolve common issues.

### 4. Updated Existing Documentation

**Files Updated:**

- **`docs/index.md`** - Reorganized with sections for Getting Started, Technical Documentation, and Resources
- **`docs/development.md`** - Added comprehensive bug fix documentation section with template and process
- **`docs/usage.md`** - Updated sample log output with actual Docker log entries
- **`README.md`** - Reorganized documentation links with better categorization

## Key Features of Bug Fix Documentation System

### 1. Monthly Organization
Bug fixes organized by `YYYY-MM/` folders for easy chronological navigation.

### 2. Comprehensive Template
Each bug fix document includes:
- Problem Description
- Root Cause Analysis (step-by-step)
- The Fix (code with reasoning)
- Testing Commands (Docker builds with env vars)
- Verification steps
- Files Modified
- Technical Notes (why it occurred)
- Lessons Learned
- Future Improvements

### 3. Pattern Tracking
Common bug patterns documented in `docs/bugfix/README.md`:
- Server Feature Parity (nginx → Node.js issues)
- Future patterns will be added as they emerge

### 4. Process Integration
Added to `docs/development.md`:
- When to document bug fixes
- How to create documentation
- Complete template reference
- Example bug fix link

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Bug Fix Documentation

```bash
# View all bug fixes
ls docs/bugfix/

# View specific bug fix
cat docs/bugfix/2025-10/vhs-video-not-playing.md

# View guidelines
cat docs/bugfix/README.md
```

### Creating New Bug Fix Documentation

1. Create month directory if needed: `docs/bugfix/YYYY-MM/`
2. Create new file: `docs/bugfix/YYYY-MM/descriptive-name.md`
3. Use template from `docs/bugfix/README.md`
4. Include all testing commands with environment variables
5. Document lessons learned

### Accessing Documentation

**GitHub:**
- Main README links to all documentation
- `docs/index.md` serves as documentation hub
- Can be hosted on GitHub Pages

**Local:**
```bash
# View documentation index
cat docs/index.md

# View server implementation
cat docs/server-implementation.md

# View troubleshooting
cat docs/troubleshooting.md
```

## Benefits

## Real-World Example

### VHS Video Not Playing Bug Fix

**File:** `docs/bugfix/2025-10/vhs-video-not-playing.md`

**Problem:** Loading VHS video stopped playing after switching from nginx to Node.js server

**Root Cause:** Missing HTTP Range Request support (RFC 7233)

**Documentation Includes:**
- Complete investigation process
- Why nginx worked but Node.js didn't
- Code changes to implement range requests
- Testing commands with Docker and environment variables
- Technical explanation of range requests
- Lessons about server feature parity

**Impact:** Future developers will immediately know to implement range request support when building custom servers.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. Automated bug fix index generation
2. Search functionality across bug fixes
3. Integration with CI/CD for prompting documentation
4. Pattern detection and alerts
5. Metrics on common bug types

### Process Improvements
1. Template refinement based on usage
2. Additional example bug fixes
3. Video tutorials for creating documentation
4. Automated testing checklist generation

## Documentation Standards

### All Documentation Should:
- ✅ Be clear and concise
- ✅ Include code examples
- ✅ Provide testing commands
- ✅ Reference related files
- ✅ Explain the "why" not just "what"

### Bug Fix Documentation Must:
