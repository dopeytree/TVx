# Bug Fix Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for major bug fixes in TVx.

## Purpose

Bug fix documentation helps:
- **Future debugging**: Understand what went wrong and why
- **Knowledge sharing**: Help other developers learn from issues
- **Project history**: Track significant problems and solutions
- **Prevent regressions**: Know what to test when making similar changes

## Directory Structure

Bug fixes are organized by year-month:

```
docs/bugfix/
├── README.md (this file)
├── 2025-10/
│   └── vhs-video-not-playing.md
├── 2025-11/
│   └── example-bug-fix.md
└── YYYY-MM/
    └── descriptive-name.md
```

## When to Create Bug Fix Documentation

Create a bug fix document when:

1. ✅ The bug significantly impacted functionality
2. ✅ The root cause was non-obvious or took significant time to find
3. ✅ The fix required understanding of architecture or system behavior
4. ✅ Other developers might encounter similar issues
5. ✅ The debugging process revealed important insights

**Do NOT document:**
- Minor typos or cosmetic fixes
- Simple one-line changes
- Obvious bugs with obvious fixes

## Bug Fix Documentation Template

Each bug fix document should include:

### 1. Header Information
```markdown
# Bug Fix: [Brief Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** branch-name
**Issue:** One-sentence summary
```

### 2. Problem Description
- What wasn't working?
- How did users experience the bug?
- What was the expected behavior?

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- Step-by-step investigation process
- What you tried that didn't work
- How you found the actual cause
- Relevant log outputs or error messages

### 4. The Fix
- Code changes made (with snippets)
- Why this approach was chosen
- Alternative solutions considered

### 5. Testing Commands
- Exact commands to reproduce the bug
- Commands to build and deploy the fix
- Commands to verify the fix works
- Include any necessary environment variables or configuration

### 6. Verification
- How to confirm the fix works
- What to look for in logs
- Expected vs actual behavior after fix

### 7. Files Modified
- List of all changed files
- Brief description of changes to each

### 8. Technical Notes
- Deeper explanation of concepts involved
- Why the bug occurred in the first place
- Related system behaviors or constraints

### 9. Related Commits
- Git commit hashes and messages
- Links to related issues or PRs

### 10. Lessons Learned
- Key takeaways from debugging
- What to check in the future
- Prevention strategies

### 11. Future Improvements (Optional)
- Better ways to solve this problem
- Related technical debt
- Monitoring or alerts to add

## Process After Fixing a Bug

After completing a bug fix:

1. **Document immediately** while details are fresh
2. **Include all commands** used during debugging and testing
3. **Add code snippets** showing before/after changes
4. **Explain the "why"** not just the "what"
5. **Update related documentation** if needed
6. **Add to this README** if the bug reveals a common pattern

## Example: Full Bug Fix Document

See `2025-10/vhs-video-not-playing.md` for a complete example showing:
- Thorough root cause analysis
- All testing commands with environment variables
- Technical explanation of HTTP Range Requests
- Lessons learned about server implementations

## Common Bug Patterns

As we document bugs, common patterns will be added here:

### Pattern: Server Feature Parity
**Example:** VHS video not playing (2025-10)
- **Problem:** Replacing nginx with custom Node.js server
- **Root Cause:** Missing HTTP Range Request support
- **Lesson:** Nginx provides many features "for free" that must be reimplemented
- **Prevention:** Test all media types when switching servers

### Pattern: [Future patterns will be added here]

## Contributing

When you fix a significant bug:

1. Create a new directory: `docs/bugfix/YYYY-MM/` (if it doesn't exist)
2. Create a new file: `descriptive-name.md`
3. Use the template above
4. Add your bug pattern to this README if it's a common issue

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether a bug fix deserves documentation, ask yourself:
- Would I want this information if I encountered this bug again in 6 months?
- Did this take me more than 2 hours to debug?
- Did I learn something important about the system?

If yes to any of these, **document it!**
