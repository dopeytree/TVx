# TVx - Modern IPTV Viewer with EPG

## Philosophy

TVx is about reclaiming the experience of "watching TV" - not endlessly scrolling through catalogs, not being bombarded with autoplay previews, just sitting down and watching. The vintage CRT aesthetic isn't mere decoration; it's a deliberate choice to make digital content feel less clinical and more inviting, like settling in front of an old television set.

This is a passion project built for the joy of it. No ads, no tracking, no subscriptions - just a clean, focused viewing experience that respects your time and attention. Creating a distraction-free, cinematic viewing experience.

### ðŸŽ¨ Vintage CRT Experience

The authentic retro television aesthetic isn't just for nostalgia - these effects serve a purpose:

- **CRT Distortion** - Subtle barrel distortion recreates the curved screen geometry of classic tube TVs, giving the image that characteristic "wrapped around glass" feel
- **Chromatic Aberration** - RGB color separation mimics the electron gun behavior in CRT displays, where red, green, and blue phosphors didn't always align perfectly at screen edges
- **Scanlines** - Horizontal scan pattern authentic to analog television technology
- **Vignette** - Edge darkening with smooth feathering simulates natural light falloff on curved glass screens
- **Edge Glass Mirage** - Vaseline-like blur on frame edges recreates the thick glass tube effect
- **Frame Edge Blur** - Controllable anti-aliasing creates the soft focus characteristic of vintage displays
- **Neon Clock** - Beautiful cyan neon tube-style time display with realistic glow and flicker

These effects combine to transform modern flat digital video into something that feels tangible and warm - like watching through actual curved glass rather than a flat LCD panel. It's the difference between "watching pixels" and "watching television."
